=======================================================

+ The czb file(compressed file) should be in the same directory where Model_Decoder.py and Train1_Dream_8.pt is located. If not the specific address should be specified.

+ A png file of the image is also produced which is optional can be commented out.

+ If there are irregularties in the decompressed dicom file. Check the values marked in the script with the ones in the actual file.
	*Note-The pixel values are always preserved. To confirm could 		      check the png file saved. Irregularties occur due to 		      some custom specification of the dicom file uploaded for 		      compression.
